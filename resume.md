## Professional Summary

Senior ML Engineer (Computer Vision & Multimodal) with 4+ years building production systems end-to-end. Led an AI-assisted judging platform for rhythmic gymnastics: multi-model video/audio/VLM pipeline achieving near-real-time performance at live events. Comfortable owning the whole stack: R&D -> training -> optimization (distillation/quantization/TensorRT) -> MLOps (Triton/ONNX/Docker/K8s) -> web/mobile delivery.

## Key skills

- Computer Vision & Video: 2D/3D pose, tracking, action/temporal recognition, keypoints, motion analysis; video understanding at scale.
- Multimodal: Video + audio + VLM (vision-language); alignment, captioning, rule-compliance checks.
- Modeling: PyTorch, DDP/FSDP multi-node, distillation, quantization; TensorRT, ONNX Runtime.
- Inference & MLOps: Triton, FastAPI/gRPC, batch/stream; Docker, CI/CD; DVC, MLflow/W&B.
- Streaming & Systems: ffmpeg, NVENC/NVDEC, RTSP/RTMP/SRT/NDI/WebRTC; Kafka/Redis; Nginx.
- Python Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy/Alembic, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, REST/gRPC & WebSocket APIs, OAuth2/JWT auth, pytest, uvicorn/gunicorn, Nginx, Docker.
- Data & Storage: PostgreSQL, Milvus/Vector DBs; data versioning, curation, labeling ops.
- Languages: Python, C++, Dart/Flutter, JS, Bash.
- GPU & Perf: CUDA/cuDNN, profiling (Nsight), latency/throughput tuning.
- Product & Teaming: tech leadership, mentorship, stakeholder comms, live-ops readiness.

## Experience

***4+ Years of experience in the field***

### *Senior Machine Learning & Full-Stack Engineer* at Sber AI

*(August 2024 – Present)*

- Built *the world’s first AI-assisted judging system for rhythmic gymnastics*, automating previously subjective scoring and introducing a new industry standard.
- Architected a complex, near real-time pipeline integrating a dozen SOTA ML models across multiple modalities — video, audio, and vision-language models to analyze both visual and audio performance criteria.
- Streamlined competition workflows and significantly reduced manual scoring overhead, deploying the system in live events (november 2025, Beijing, Sky Grace Cup) and setting a new benchmark for AI in sports judging.
- Combined hands-on development with team leadership: onboarded and led a small development team (4 people), presented milestones to stakeholders, and ensured robust deployment using MLOps and DevOps best practices.

### *Middle Machine Learning Engineer* at Nanosemantics

*(April 2023 - August 2024)*

- Trained and deployed SOTA person identification pipeline (based on face recognition)
- Created SOTA Russian sign language recognition and Russian lip reading models which work real-time on mobile devices
- Added to- and upgraded existing CV functionality in the existing project (tracking, identification, embedding search)
- Implemented video captioning in Russian within higly contstrained resources and initially low quality data
- Pushed for internal processes impovements and code quality

### *Data Scientist* at Ulyanovsk State University

*(September 2021 - February 2022)*

- Created AI assisted video surveillance system
- [Contibuted to research paper on anemia (ML + analysis of tabular data - presence/absence of antigens)](https://github.com/EmpyEmpt/Anemia-modeling)
- Implemented a recommendation system that offers relevant campus activities for students
- Created a data mart of students' records for over 10 years
- Read several lectures on machine learning

### *Teacher/Mentor* at OTUS Online School

*(October 2022 - August 2024)*

- Mentored over 100 students with homework and graduation works
- Reworked and modernized ML, DL and Computer Vision courses
